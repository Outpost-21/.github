## Outpost 21 Mods
Can't use Steam? All O21 mods are available on GitHub in public repos now! Refer to the Steam Workshop for information on them as generally they will not have a wiki, or even a readme. If they do not have a Workshop page, they are not yet released and likely heavily WIP if even functional at all.

### Support
Like the mods and want to show some support? Anyone is welcome to do so via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/neronix17), huge thanks to everyone who has supported me even a little, it's literally prevented me from starving, or running out of utilities more often than I'd like to admit. If you can't afford to don't worry, there's always going to be some free posts if you just follow (completely free) instead.

### Issues
You can submit a ticket on any of the mods if you have any issues. Make sure that:
- You are up to date ([cloning the repo using GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop) is the easiest way, you then just fetch the latest version when you want to update)
- If you are downloading the zip directly and using that make sure to DELETE old versions first! Overwriting isn't enough in the case where a file is removed/renamed and WILL cause problems!
- Provide steps to reproduce it, if I can't then it's much harder for me to even guess how to fix. If it's a random issue that doesn't appear to have steps, it probably does and is just hard to figure out, so try to include as much info as you can if you can't figure out exact steps.
- Include a HugsLib Log using Ctrl + F12 in-Game or clicking the Share button on the log window when it's open, if you can't upload the log, you can always copy to clipboard!

If you're not using HugsLib, then use it, this isn't a debate, you either use it or you do not get help as I CAN'T without it in most cases.

Ideally you can save us both a lot of time if you:
- Check you can reproduce the issue in a minimal list, this will hopefully rule out conflicts.
- If it IS a conflict, narrow down what mod it is happening with.

Odds are that if it's a conflict, only you will be able to find it, I do not have the time to test every mod in everyones mod list that has an issue to find it, and for all we know it could be an outdated version of that mod that's causing the problem and would be impossible for me to find. The best way to deal with this is a binary search, which is loading up with half your mods enabled, if it's still breaking then the conflict is still loaded, and you just repeat until you narrow it down, at most this should only take a handful of tries. It's best to use an external mod manager like RimPy or RimSort so you can save/load your original list easily.

### Got a fix yourself?
In the less than yearly occurrence that you have a fix you want to contribute you are absolutely welcome to do so with a pull request.

### Looking for a mod and can't find it?
You may be looking for one of the series GitHubs instead! When a mod series is multiple modules I will tend to split them off into their own Organization here on GitHub for easier managing of contributors as well as the mods themselves.

Links to them are here:
- [Outland](https://github.com/O21-Outland) - Medieval/Fantasy modules revolving around my own custom lore inspired by a variety of universes that I don't want to make whole dedicated mods for.
- [Outer Rim](https://github.com/O21-Outer-Rim) - Series of Star Wars based mods, spanning all eras of Canon with Legends and even the occasional fanon where I think it fits.
- [CosmoRim](https://github.com/CosmoRim) - Late Industrial/Spacer modules revolving around my own custom lore inspired by a variety of...it's space Outland ok.
- [Halo](https://github.com/O21-Halo) - Series of mods based on the Halo video games, including humans, covenant, forerunners and flood.
- [Stargate](https://github.com/O21-Stargate) - Series of mods based on the Stargate franchise, taking bits and pieces from all series and occasionally some things that only made it into novels/comics/etc.
- [NirnRim](https://github.com/O21-NirnRim) - Series of mods based on the Elder Scrolls franchise, reinterpreting things to work in RimWorld without focusing too much on a single game from that franchise.
- [Rim-Effect: Legacy](https://github.com/Rim-Effect-Legacy) - Humanoid Alien Races 2.0 based original, unchanged and maintained as is.
- [Rim-Effect: Renegade](https://github.com/Rim-Effect-Reborn) - Biotech and Asimov based remix, with alterations and additions that were made to fit my own personal tastes more.

Why don't I split everything like this? Because it's a lot of work maintaining seperated modules over one big one, and I'd personally prefer to just have the lot at once anyway, I only separate mods into smaller modules when I know it's going to be a problematic scale some day.
