## Outpost 21 Mods
Can't use Steam? All O21 mods are available on GitHub in public repos now! Refer to the Steam Workshop for information on them as generally they will not have a wiki, or even a readme.

### Issues
You can submit a ticket on any of the mods if you have any issues. Make sure that:
- You are up to date (cloning the repo using GitHub Desktop is the easiest way, you can then just fetch the latest version!)
- Provide steps to reproduce it, if I can't then it's much harder for me to even guess how to fix. If it's a random issue that doesn't appear to have steps, it probably does and is just hard to figure out, so try to include as much info as you can if you can't figure out exact steps.
- Include a HugsLib Log using Ctrl + F12 in-Game or clicking the Share button on the log window when it's open, if you can't upload the log, you can always copy to clipboard!

If you're not using HugsLib, then use it, this isn't a debate, you either use it or you do not get help as I CAN'T without it in most cases.

Ideally you can save us both a lot of time if you:
- Check you can reproduce the issue in a minimal list, this will hopefully rule out conflicts.
- If it IS a conflict, narrow down what mod it is happening with.

Odds are that if it's a conflict, only you will be able to find it, I do not have the time to test every mod in everyones mod list that has an issue to find it, and for all we know it could be an outdated version of that mod that's causing the problem and would be impossible for me to find. The best way to deal with this is a binary search, which is loading up with half your mods enabled, if it's still breaking then the conflict is still loaded, and you just repeat until you narrow it down, at most this should only take a handful of tries. It's best to use an external mod manager like RimPy or RimSort so you can save/load your original list easily.

### Got a fix yourself?
In the less than yearly occurrence that you have a fix you want to contribute you are absolutely welcome to do so with a pull request.
